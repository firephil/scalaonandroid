###Calculator

This is a simple, but actually practical app for both Android and desktop. It's built on top of the [HelloFXML](https://github.com/makingthematrix/scalaonandroid/tree/main/HelloFXML) example. GUI is based on [a JavaFX tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5ifU9kkp6g) by Kody Simpson and consists of the main view made in Scene Builder and a history dialog which pops up after clicking a button. The logic is written by me from scratch.

1. The main view
2. `pom.xml` differences in comparison to HelloFXML
3. How JavaFX supports the MVC pattern (or maybe MVP?)
4. The reflection issue and how to go around it
5. The Android app icon and other settings
